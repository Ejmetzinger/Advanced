		<h2>EveryDay Life</h2>
		<h3>My day consists of going to school,coming home,doing work and then repeating that cycle over again and again. I don't really do anything on the week days but on the weekends I enjoy going out and yard sailing or going to the mountains to explore and hike. I also have animals, and they are all special to me. I used to go to a private school called Alta Loma Christian School.  <h3>
